The scatter plot shows that there is a positive correlation between annual income and spending score. This means that, in general, customers with higher incomes tend to spend more money at the mall. However, there is also a lot of variation within each cluster. For example, there are some customers with high incomes who have low spending scores, and there are some customers with low incomes who have high spending scores.

The K-means clustering algorithm has grouped the customers into five clusters based on their annual income and spending scores. The clusters are as follows:

Cluster 1 (red): Customers with low incomes and low spending scores.
Cluster 2 (orange): Customers with medium incomes and medium spending scores.
Cluster 3 (yellow): Customers with high incomes and medium spending scores.
Cluster 4 (green): Customers with low incomes and high spending scores.
Cluster 5 (blue): Customers with high incomes and high spending scores.
